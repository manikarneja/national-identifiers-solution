Analyzing, Reviewing, Surveying and Reforming the current national identifier backend (Aadhar data retention by third party and Privacy Concerns associated with the same)

ABSTRACT
The Project consists of analysing, reviewing, surveying and reforming the
current national identifier backend (Aadhar Data retention and Privacy
concerns around the same).
It mainly consists of discussion about the current issues in Aadhar backend
and the logistic and technological solutions to cater the same. Survey work
involved knowing what people already know about the data laws and
whether national security is well off a reason to give away data privacy.
The proposed solutions are laid after reading numerous articles and
research papers on how data can be kept confidential without sacrificing
the primary intentions of national identifiers like Aadhar. Blockchain and
Federated Learning are discussed as primary technological backing in the
proposed solutions in detail with a sample functioning client-server
architecture with minimal computational overhead and energy overhead.
